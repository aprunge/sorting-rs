Sure! Here are brief explanations of some major sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort:
   - Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
   - Repeat this process until the entire array is sorted.

2. Selection Sort:
   - Find the minimum (or maximum) element in the unsorted part of the array.
   - Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
   - Repeat this process, gradually reducing the unsorted part, until the array is sorted.

3. Insertion Sort:
   - Build the sorted array in place, shifting elements as necessary.
   - Start with the second element and compare it with the elements before it, moving them one position ahead if they are greater.
   - Repeat this process until the entire array is sorted.

4. Merge Sort:
   - Divide the array into two halves.
   - Recursively sort each half.
   - Merge the sorted halves back together to create the final sorted array.

5. Quicksort:
   - Select a pivot element from the array (often the last element).
   - Partition the array so that all elements smaller than the pivot come before it, and all elements larger come after it.
   - Recursively apply the same process to the two subarrays on either side of the pivot until the entire array is sorted.

6. Heapsort:
   - Build a max-heap from the array (a complete binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its children).
   - Swap the root node (maximum value) with the last element and remove it from the heap.
   - Rebuild the heap by sifting down the new root.
   - Repeat this process until the entire array is sorted.

7. Counting Sort:
   - Count the frequency of each unique element in the array.
   - Calculate the running sum of the frequencies to determine the positions of the elements in the final sorted array.
   - Place each element in its respective position in the sorted array.

8. Radix Sort:
   - Sort the elements by their digits or bits, from the least significant to the most significant.
   - Perform this sorting process for each digit or bit position until the entire array is sorted.
